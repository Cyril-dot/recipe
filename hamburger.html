            <h1> Simple Hamburger Stroganoff </h1>
            <p> I created this beef stroganoff recipe with hamburger because I love the taste of a good stroganoff, but I don't like the expense of beef tips, steak, or roast beef, nor do I like all the time it takes to make them. My version is creamy and tastes great.</p>

            <h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>
    <li>
        Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rapid boil. 
        Cook egg noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 7 to 9 minutes. 
        Drain.
    </li>
    <li>
        Meanwhile, cook ground beef in a large skillet over medium-high heat, 
        stirring occasionally, until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; 
        drain and discard grease. 
        Stir in cream cheese, mushrooms with liquid, and gravy mix; 
        cook and stir over medium heat until cream cheese melts, 2 to 3 minutes. 
        Add condensed soup, sour cream, and milk; 
        cook, stirring occasionally, until smooth and creamy, 3 to 5 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Drain egg noodles; stir into the beef mixture. 
        Cook until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.
    </li>
</ol>
